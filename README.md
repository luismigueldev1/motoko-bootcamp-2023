# Motoko Bootcamp 2023

This is a public repo about the code challenges and projects for Motoko bootcamp 2023

## How it works

To run locally all the code challenges per day you only need to run the following commands.

to run the local testnet:

```
    dfx start
```

to run a specific canister:

```
    dfx deploy <canister_name>
```

where <canister_name> is the folder_name on the root directory for example:

```
    dfx deploy day_1
```

after that you can test the canister via Candid interface.
