# Motoko Bootcamp 2023

This is a public repo about the code challenges and projects for Motoko bootcamp 2023.

## How it works

to run locally all the code challenges per day you only need to run the following command.

```
    dfx deploy <canister_name>
```

where <canister_name> is the folder_name for example on the root project:

```
    dfx deploy day_1
```

after that you can test the canister via Candid interface.
